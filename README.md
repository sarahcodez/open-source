## What is it?

Open source is a development model that encourages universal access and redistribution of the project’s source *(code, blueprints, etc.)*, allowing for third-party modification.

Open source celebrates open exchange, collaborative participation, rapid prototyping, transparency, meritocracy, and community development, and enables self-enhancing diversity of a project’s production.

## Not just software

* Media Content *(Wikimedia Foundation)*
* Hardware *(OpenMoko mobile phones, Lasersaur laser cutter)*
* Beverages *(Open Source Cola, Brewtopia)*
* Firearms *(Defense Distributed 3D printed firearms)*
* Medicine *(Tropical Disease Initiative and the Open Source Drug Discovery for Malaria Consortium)*
* Religion *(Open Siddur Project, Open Source Yoga Unity)*
* Education *(Kahn Academy, Wikiversity)*

## The Roots of Open Source

* Existed long before computing (automobile patents, early 1900s)
* SHARE user group (IBM, 1950s)
* Request for Comments (telecommunications protocols, 1960s)
* Officially named “open source” (or OSS) when split from the “free software” movement (Netscape, 1998) 
  * Free as in beer (freeware) vs. Free as in speech (OSS)

## What it looks like today

* Web and Mobile Application development
* Source Control (Git, SVN, etc)
* Social Source Control Platforms (Github, Google Code) & Forking
* Open Governance Model
* Rapid releases & strict versioning
* Modularization

## Examples of Open Source Projects

* Linux
* Android
* Node / io.js
* Angular.js
* Apache
* Eclipse IDE
* Atom text editor

## How to get involved

* Learn and regularly use [IRC chat](http://www.ircbeginner.com/)
* Open and maintain an active Github account
* Commit publicly whatever code you can
* When you find an interesting piece of software, ask about and review the source code
* If you find a bug, patch it and submit it
* [up-for-grabs.net](http://up-for-grabs.net)
